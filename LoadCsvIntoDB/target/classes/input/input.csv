I accrued some medical debt within the last two years.  <br><br>I used my credit cards to cover the medical expenses my insurance didn't cover.  I am in excellent condition now.  I am slightly surprised about the score Transunion gave me.  I have been running my three credit reports and scores monthly through Experian for the last year and my score always averages 725 - 739 for all three Credit Reporting Agencies.  When checking my credit report directly through Transunion, my score was lower.  <br><br>I am in the process of consolidating my student loans.  The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.  The student  loan payment is $161 per month and in good standing.  Consolidating the installments/loans will increase my credit score by approximately 15 points. <br>",credit_card,Credit Card Consolidation,CA,Jan-2014,3866

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

I strongly believe if I can consolidate that I can eliminate my current debt and move closer to my dream of home ownership.  This cannot be possible until I payoff my current debt.  Thank you for you time and hopefully your investment.<br><br>  Borrower added on 12/20/11 > As the last day approaches for funding I really hope you will trust and invest in me.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.  Thank you so much for your time.<br>",debt_consolidation,DebtConsolidate,WA,Nov-2014,18.74

We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral. I would simply like to have one payment and close out all the little cards so I can have a little piece of mind.

By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have.

The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which Im able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.

But instead of trying to get our customers excited about causes we are passionate about, we are going to become passionate about the causes they already care about. That is why we are letting our customers choose what cause they want their 10% to support. So we???ve decided to stand for action rather than any particular cause.

Thank you for considering my consolidation loan. Consolidating my 23% debt into an 11.71% rate is obviously a good move and will help me attain my goal of becoming debt-free more quickly.<br/><br/>As soon as my loan is approved, I will set up an automatic draft from my bank account. It will be paid automatically the day after I receive each of my paychecks. Therefore, there is no chance I would ever be late on a payment.<br/><br/>My job is extremely stable. I work in a small business that has been in existence for more than 25 years. We have approximately 20 employees. The contracts that comprise my nearly $200,000 portfolio have been signed for three year extensions or are already self-renewing each year. Even if I were to lose any contracts, which is unlikely given my service ratings (and the fact that I've never once lost a contract), the owner of the company would not let me go. We receive more requests for proposal than we can service at this time, so there is never a lack of contracts to serve.<br/><br/>I am willing to provide any additional information or details that is requested of me. Again, I appreciate your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 11/07/11 > I would like to add that I am consolidating debt to lower the rate and pay it off more quickly.  I do not want people to think I am seeking to consolidate because I have been missing payments.  I have never missed or been late with a payment.  I ensure my bills are set up automatically though my bank account on a recurring basis so that I don't risk letting a payment slip my mind.

During the last 3 financially-difficult years for the economy, my employer has continued to grow amidst an industry that on average has seen double-digit declines in revenues.

Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial.

I've always been a responsible person, but things piled up quickly when my dream job at a great nonprofit collapsed in the fall of 2008. This job paid me well, and was something I had worked toward for years. Unfortunately, as a fairly new organization, the timing of the bank crises that year led to a serious shortage of incoming revenue when we were between projects and needed it most.<br/><br/>I was forced to live off of my credit cards for months until finding a new job, which was a major lifestyle adjustment. I've gotten back on my feet, but I can barely make enough to pay off my bills, and the high interest rates are killing me. I feel sick every time I see how much money I'm paying to the big banks every month in fees and interest, and I'm excited about using Lending Club to get out from under that terrible cycle. The way this works makes me feel like I'll be proud to pay this off (since it's going to normal people), instead of resentful that the banks (who were bailed out by our government) will continue to line their pockets with my money. I assure you that your investment will be sound! I'm genuinely pumped to get this going and get out from under the banks.<br/><br/>Thanks so much!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Saying goodbye to credit card debt,MN,Sep-2014,1333.69

I have been able to successfully pay off significant home-related debt (initial remodeling, plumbing replacements, etc) in less than a year following 2 promotions (one with my civilian job, the other with my military reserve career) and I'm benefiting from yet another overseas deployment, so I want these things gone!  This will free up cash to finish paying off another debt in the next 90 days before returning to the US.  Excellent payment history - I see no need to stick with a store card (Sears, 17%, used to replace roof on home thus increasing value of property; purchased at $210K in 2009) and a regular credit card (Chase, 23%, they raised it years ago and I have never been able to argue them down, regardless of impeccable payment history and credit score).  I opted for the short-term 3 year loan; I see no need to extend payments if you don't need to.  I appreciate Lending Clubs ease of use, so I opted to use LC again (I have a current loan at 6% for an emergency pool cave in/repair last summer) after failing to find another option that can compare to the quick financing, initial interaction with potential lenders (Q&amp;A when initially funding the loan), and competitive rates.  Other options on the web did not meet the threshold to satisfy the two debts I listed above, or their interest rates were equally abysmal.  I hope this answers some questions up front.

And this loan will be an important key in the success of my life changing goals.  I plan to use these funds to pay down credit card debt, student loan debt and I am also thinking about using a small portion for something very personal that will change my life forever.  I know I am going to be a great borrower due to the fact that, as I have stated, I take great pride in my financial well-being.  Also, I work for a bank in a department that deals with helping homeowners.  This experience has without a doubt opened my eyes to what can happen when money and budgets are not managed correctly and/or logically, therefore I know what it truly means to be a good borrower to any financial institution that lends money.  My Monthly budget is a simple one, most of my debt is from a couple of credit cards, 1 installment loan, student loans and my rent, which is not a lot because I have 2 roommates and that helps to keep the living expenses down considerably.  I have a car that is completely paid off and is in great condition.  I would be more than happy to answer any questions regarding my monthly budget if more detail is required.  As I have stated I am employed at a Bank, and I feel that after 7 years of working at the bank, I know I have a very stable job.  I was just recently promoted to a much more important role, and this promotion is more proof of how stable my job is and also demonstrates a little more of how I will be a good borrower.

We spent over $45 Billion in 2010 on our pets and it is estimated to surpass $50 Billion in 2011, doubling what was spent in 2001.<br/>Analysts report that even during the recent economic slowdown; pet owners are still pampering their pets. This trend is expected to continue at a rate of 9%+ per year.<br/><br/>When we must leave our pets behind, we want a clean, safe and caring boarding facility. Most pet owners expect more than a cage and 2 walks a day&hellip;We want our pets to enjoy themselves in a secure facility that is friendly, fun and peaceful.  Also, families are opting for active doggie daycares to offer their pets a chance to socialize and exercise while they work.<br/><br/>As Florida&rsquo;s population expanded over the last 10 years, luxury pet boarding and day care facilities have not kept up with the pace. We feel that there is an unmet need in our community.<br/><br/>We propose opening a luxury pet boarding and pet daycare facility with indoor and outdoor exercise enclosures.<br/><br/>Service Description<br/><br/>Pet Boarding: A minimum of 30 suites for overnight pet guest 365 days a year. We will offer a variety of luxury indoor accommodations with flat screen TV, climate-control and 24 hour staff to monitor the facility. 	    <br/><br/>Overnight fees will range from $30.00 to $50.00 per 24 hour stay, plus additional fees such as Playtime, Pup-Corn &amp; Movie, Yappy Hour, Twist &amp; Treat Yummy, Daycare Workout, Going Home Bath and more.<br/><br/>Doggie Daycare: We will provide the ultimate dog daycare service Monday thru Sat. Allowing each pet to exercise with our staff and socialize with other pets of similar disposition.<br/> 		   <br/>Daycare fees will range from $15.00 for a half day to $25.00 for a full day. We will offer pre-paid discounts packages for our regular customers.<br/><br/>Financial Potential<br/><br/>Based on analysis of local boarding rates and average occupancy, we project gross revenues of $171,720.00 during the first year, based on combined revenues from boarding and daycare operations. This projection is based on an average occupancy of 50% annually.<br/><br/>Operating expenses, including employees are projected to be 70% of gross revenue, generating a $51,416.00 pre-tax profit the first year. <br/><br/><br/>List of Major Start-up Expenses:<br/><br/>Paid From Start-up Capital<br/>Lease Deposit		$  7,500.00<br/>License/Permits		$  1,000.00<br/>Utility Deposits		$  1,000.00<br/>Insurance		$  1,000.00<br/>Pet Boarding Area		$18,000.00<br/>Miscellaneous 		$ 5,000.00<br/> Total		$33,500<br/>",small_business,Pet Boarding,FL,Dec-2014,257.19

I am a Federal Employee (22 years) and have incredibly strong job security, which is rare in these days.  I track all my expenses in Quicken, know my budget and always stay within my means.  I use credit cards only for online purchases, flights, or major purchases.  Unfortunately, I have had to make several major purchases over the past year.  I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.  For instance, last year I refinanced my home as I could lower my interest rate by 2.5%.  .<br/>",other,Other Loan,MA,May-2012,254.44

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.

As I have fully disclosed, my successful participation over the last 21/2 years in a DMP has resulted in the &ldquo;pay-off&rdquo; of over $31,000 of debt since January 1, 2009.  Notwithstanding the reported closure/cancellation of participating accounts,<br/><br/>My &ldquo;credit worthiness&rdquo; has been established over the course of my long-reported credit history.<br/>Particularly over the last few years, I have consistently maintained &ldquo;responsible credit management practices&rdquo; that clearly demonstrate that I possess the discipline and income capacity to meet my past, present and future financial obligations.  Investors&rsquo; review of my posted credit history will confirm my consistent payment history.   .  <br/><br/>In addition, my posted current salary is based on well established professional employment (civil service), which provides the type of income stability that investors should demand to assure a very acceptable return on your investment, as contractually agreed to.   <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 09/20/11 > DMP - FULL DISCLOSURE<br/><br/>On January 1, 2009, I held 11 active and &ldquo;current&rdquo; credit card/installment accounts totaling slightly over $38,000.  I wanted to consolidate the 11 separate account payments into one single, manageable payment to be made under better terms agreed to by the 11 creditors.  After evaluating my options, I determined that, rather than try to deal with each creditor individually; I &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibly&rdquo; entered into a Debt Management Plan (DMP) with the 11 creditors.  Under the DMP, the 11 participating creditors agreed to reduce interest rates and min. payments&hellip;and the 11 separate account payments were consolidated into one manageable payment of $1,174/mon. (includes $35/mon. fee)&hellip;.. Part of the deal agreed to by the 11 creditors under their accepted participation in the DMP, was the cancellation of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts, and updating of my Credit Report by including the following statement for each participating account:  &ldquo;account canceled/closed by credit grantor&rdquo;.  Therefore, my Credit Report now shows 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts with this inserted statement.  However, my Credit Report now also reflects the fact that, 8 of the 11 accounts are reported as; &ldquo;paid-in-full ($0 balance)&rdquo;, as a result of my payment of over $31,000 during the last 21/2 years.  <br/><br/>The remaining 3 of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts have a total remaining balance of about $7,800.  The remaining &ldquo;current&rdquo; DMP accounts include:<br/>BofA Gold Option ($4,670) &ndash; req. min. $204/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Visa ($720) &ndash; req. min. $88/mon @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Personal ($2,380) &ndash; req. min. $125/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/> Borrower added on 09/23/11 > FINAL THOUGHTS FOR INVESTORS' CONSIDERATION<br/><br/>See It.......Feel It.......Trust It<br/>null",debt_consolidation,REORGANIZATION/CONSOLIDATION,CA,Jan-2015,8803.4

I took one out last year through Lending Club, which went very well. I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.<br/><br/>I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount.

Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner.

We are trying to purchase at the extremely low rate of 3%.  This would be converting our existing land contract into traditional financing thru a local bank.  Current land contract interest is 8%.  Our current payment is $3,100 monthly.  We have been approved for a 95% loan, at 3% for thirty years (5 yr arm fixed, then adjustable, max 8% apr for life of loan after five years).  PMI is waived on this loan.  Our new payment, including property tax, would be $1,900, thus a net decrease in monthly mortgage payment of $1,200 if we can move forward with traditional financing.  We would save upwards of $18,000 yearly on interest alone.<br> We do have some revolving debt, and have been placing most of our extra cash into paying down this revolving debt (which we have decreased by 50% over the last year, and we will continue to do so at an even higher rate if we can attain this loan), but because of aggressively paying down revolving debt, we have only accumulated a small amount of savings.

I worked part time at a local restaurant to pay off bills etc while looking for a full time job.  At this point, I started falling behind on my bills and hence the debt on my 2 credit cards.  I now have a very stable job and I am working on a program that is funded for the next 30 years.  I am a very responsible person and I've never had a late payment on any of my loans.

My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br/><br/>My FICO:<br/><br/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>$18,000 total<br/>(10,511 to pay off/refi Lending Club)<br/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br/><br/><br/>Why 60 month term? <br/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br/><br/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br/><br/>Is my job safe?<br/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br/><br/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.  I have funds in reserves to cover me should anything happen to my job.  I have a low debt to income ratio (20-26%).  I have no mortgage or rent.  I have inclining income, stable job, AND residence.  Last and certainly not least, I have perfect pay history with all lenders, MOST IMPORTANTLY, with Lending Club.  I have never been late on any payments on any debt...ever.  <br/><br/>More questions?

Shortly after graduation, before I could make significant headway on my debt, congress passed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD) in 2009.  As a response to this legislation, the interest rates on many of my cards skyrocketed, even though I have never been late on a payment and have always paid more than minimum.  This event made making real debt reduction even more difficult.<br/><br/>Securing this credit card consolidation loan will be a concrete step forward in improving my financial situation, as I will use it to pay off the credit cards that &quot;adjusted&quot; to the higher rates in 2009.  As a result, my outlook will greatly improve in at least three ways: 1) The interest rate reduction will result in greater monthly positive cash flow to service the remainder of my debts and 2) The transition of revolving credit to non-revolving will improve my credit score, which will allow me to 3) seek interest rate reductions on my other credit cards.  Even if #3 is unsuccesful, the positive impact of the other noted effects are too good to ignore at this time.<br/><br/>As far as my employment outlook, I have been with my current employer for the past 2 1/2 years, during which time I have been promoted once and have been told that I will be again this year.  I have strategically positioned myself in the company as a critical asset to several high-profile projects, which greatly reduces the prospect for lay-off, even in the current economic/political climate.  However, given the worst case scenario of job loss, my prospects for securing replacement employment are almost guaranteed, given my experience in the defense industry, my skill set, the location in which I live, and my security clearance.<br/><br/>My current monthly debt obligations, outside of the balances that would be paid off with this loan's proceeds, are:<br/>$2294 - Mortgage<br/>$750 - Credit cards<br/>$394 - Student loan<br/>$258 - Auto loan<br/><br/>Please note that there were significant contributing factors to my accrual of this revolving debt; but unfortunately I have been informed that I cannot include these in my loan description, as they may give hints to information that is disallowed by law in loan considerations.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in funding this request.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Consolidation Loan,MD,Dec-2015,344.11

The loan I am requesting is for my company which is located in Los Angeles, CA.  A place thriving of actors/actresses, independent film makers, production companies, and film studios.  I am currently employed with 2 jobs to aid in the funding for my business, one I have been employed at for 4 years, the other job over 1 year.<br/>     I am still in the development stages of my business, I have invested over 15K of my own money to help build the business (i.e. permit, registrations, equipment, storage.)  I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on all the services my company has to offer to draw in customers, and also I have 4 years experience as an Independent film maker/actor as well so I know exactly what services are in high demand.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am the only company to offer multiple services (acting classes, headshots, film equipment rentals, etc.) at one location. <br/>     With this loan, I will be able to invest in various advertising campaigns, (online, newspaper, flyers, etc.) as well as business cards, brochures, outdoor signs, and a new website.   For the first 1-2 years, my plan is to take all gross profits and 1st, repay any loan(s), and 2nd to invest back into my business to further expand my inventory and reach my goal of doubling my income from year one, and tripling my income for year 3 of business. With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas.<br/>",small_business,Business,CA,May-2014,934.08
